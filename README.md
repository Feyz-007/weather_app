## Features

- **Homepage (`/`)**: Displays a welcome message.
- **Weather Endpoint (`/weather`)**: Returns weather data for a specified city.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Version 18 or later.
2. **NPM**: Comes with Node.js.
3. **Railway CLI**: For deployment to Railway.
4. **GitHub Account**: For hosting the repository and setting up GitHub Actions.
5. **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: For fetching weather data.
6. **Jest**: For running unit tests.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather_app.git
cd weather_app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Jest

Jest is used for testing. Make sure you have Jest installed as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest supertest
```

Add a `test` script to your `package.json` if it's not already present:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "test": "jest"
}
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

```plaintext
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
```

### 5. Set Up GitHub Secrets

To secure your API key and Railway token, use GitHub Secrets:

- **Go to your GitHub repository**.
- **Navigate to Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
- Click on **New repository secret**.
- Add the following secrets:
  - `WEATHER_API_KEY`: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
  - `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: Your Railway authentication token.
  - `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Railway product ID.

## Running the Application Locally

Start the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the welcome message. Test the `/weather` endpoint by visiting `http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London`.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite with Jest:

```bash
npm test
```

Jest will execute the tests defined in the `tests` directory and display the results. Ensure you have proper test cases defined to validate your application's functionality.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow includes steps for:

1. **Installing Dependencies**: Uses `npm ci` for a clean install.
2. **Running Tests**: Executes `npm test` to ensure code quality.
3. **Deploying to Railway**: Uses `railway up` to deploy the application.

### Workflow File (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Hereâ€™s an example `ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
      env:
        WEATHER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WEATHER_API_KEY }}

    - name: Install Railway CLI
      run: npm install -g @railway/cli

    - name: Deploy to Railway
      run: railway up --service your-service-name
      env:
        RAILWAY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
        WEATHER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WEATHER_API_KEY }}
        RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID }}
```

## Deploying to Railway

### 1. Install Railway CLI

Install the Railway CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### 2. Log In to Railway

Authenticate with Railway:

```bash
railway login
```

### 3. Deploy the Application

Deploy your application:

```bash
railway up --service your-service-name
```

Replace `your-service-name` with the name of your Railway service.

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment Issues**: Check the Railway dashboard for logs and deployment status.
- **Test Failures**: Review test logs in GitHub Actions to identify and fix issues.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that GitHub Secrets are correctly configured and accessible in your GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Local vs. CI Environment**: Ensure that your local environment and CI/CD environment are correctly configured with the necessary environment variables and dependencies.


**Note:** Replace placeholders like `https://github.com/your-username/weather_app.git`, `your_openweathermap_api_key`, and `your-service-name` with actual values relevant to your setup.
